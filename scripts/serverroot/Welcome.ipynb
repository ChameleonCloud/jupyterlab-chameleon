    "We have prepared a few tutorials you may want to check out, if you'd like to learn more about Chameleon. They're located in our sharing portal, [Trovi](https://chameleoncloud.org/experiment/share/). Check it out! There are a lot of great resources there. In particular, we include some helpful tutorials and examples. We update and add to these notebooks over time as new features are released or new tutorials are created, so if you haven't checked in a while, take some time to see if there's anything new that looks interesting to you.\n",
